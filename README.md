# ImageBanker: Object Collector & Saver

<img src="assets/logo.png" alt="Logo generated with Dall-E" width="200"/>

ImageBanker is a very simple web app for retrieving an object without background.
The main advantage is the ability to detect objects in the photo, so you do not need to take a standardized photo to crop an object - just select it from an old image, for example.

The implementation is not scratch-built: YoloV8 and rembg are used for detection and cropping.

## How do I use it?

Pretty straightforward! Go to the webapp, take a photo, choose the object you want to crop, then download the image if you are happy with the crop. Here is gif example of a use:

## Installation

For now, the webapp is not hosted online, you will have to install it by yourself on your laptop.

- Create a virtualenv and activate it, I use conda:

```shell
conda create -n my_env python=3.11 -y

conda activate my_env
```

- Git clone the repo and install it:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/MathisNcl/image-banker.git
cd image-banker
pip install -e .
```

- run app:

```shell
make app
# Wait for app to start, the first time is slower
```

Now your webapp is avaliable in your laptop at: <http://localhost:8501>.

For another device with same wifi at: <http://192.168.1.42:8501>!

Enjoy!üéâüéâ

## ‚öóÔ∏è Future features

- [ ] Add parameters to remove background
- [ ] Personnal implementation of removing background to remove huge memory dependancies
